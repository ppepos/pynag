"""
This module provides a high level Object-Oriented wrapper
around pynag.Parsers.

Example:

>>> import pynag.Model
>>>
>>> all_services = pynag.Model.Service.objects.all
>>> my_service = all_services[0]
>>> print my_service.host_name # doctest: +SKIP
localhost
>>>
>>> example_host = pynag.Model.Host.objects.filter(host_name="host.example.com")
>>> canadian_hosts = pynag.Model.Host.objects.filter(host_name__endswith=".ca")
>>>
>>> for i in canadian_hosts:
...     i.alias = "this host is located in Canada"
...     i.save() # doctest: +SKIP
